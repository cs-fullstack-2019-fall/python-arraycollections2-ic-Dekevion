# Python review IC


### Problem 1:
Create code and define the variable below outside of any function. After you create the list variable write a function called ```process_number_list``` that takes an array as a parameter, and performs the functions listed below in the instructions. 

```
person_array = ["Kenn", "Kevin", "Erin", "Autumn"]
```
a) Print the 2nd element of the person_array

b) Print the first and last elements of the person_array

c) Take out the 2nd element (```Kevin```) from the list

### Problem 2:
* Ask the User for a starting and ending number
* Write a function that takes the 2 numbers as parameters and builds a list/array of numbers with the values from start to end parameters and return the array to the caller
* Print the sum of the numbers in the list using an 'f' string (ex. ```The sum of the numbers from 5 to 100 is ```5050```)

### Problem 4:
Use the following list of 5 numbers. 
```score_list = [21,14,6,8,28,42,21]```

Write the code to find the element where the score is equal to ```6```

### Challenge:
Using the same list from Problem 4, write a program that removes the smallest and the largest value from the list and adds them to a newly created list. Your code should work regardless of the numbers in the list.
