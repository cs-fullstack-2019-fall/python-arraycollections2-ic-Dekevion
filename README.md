# Python review IC


### Problem 1:
Create code anddefine the variable below outside of any function. After you create the list variable write a function called ```stupid_array_tricks``` that takes an array as a parameter, and performs the functions listed below in the instructions. 

```
person_array = ["Kenn", "Kevin", "Erin", "Autumn"]
```
a) Print the 2nd and 3rd elements of the person_array using a *range*

b) Print the last 2 elements of the person_array using a *range*

c) Insert the new element ```Chuck``` between the 2nd (```Kevin```) and 3rd (```Erin```) elements

d) Take out the 2nd element (```Kevin```) from the list

### Problem 2:
##### We will keep having this problem until EVERYONE gets it right without help
Create a function that has a loop that quits with ‘q’. If the user doesn't enter 'q', ask them to input another string.

### Problem 3:
Create a function that uses the data list below.
```
['GOOD_DATA',
'DECENT_DATA',
'BAD_DATA',
'DECENT_DATA',
'GOOD_DATA'
'BAD_DATA',
'GOOD_DATA',
'DECENT_DATA',
'BAD_DATA',
'GOOD_DATA']
```

Write the code to do the following:
* Print the length of the original DATA list/array (ex. ```Starting length of data list is 10```)
* Remove all ```BAD_DATA``` from the DATA list/array 
* Print the length of the final DATA list/array (ex. ```Ending length of data list is 7```)

### Problem 4:
Use the following list of 5 numbers. 
```score_list = [21,14,6,8,28,42,21]```


Write the code to do the following:
* Print the sum of the numbers (ex. ```The SUM of the numbers is 140 ```)
* Print the maximum value from the numbers (ex. ```The MAX of the numbers is 140 ```)
* Print the minimum value from the numbers (ex. ```The MIN value of the numbers is 6 ```)



### Problem 5:
Create a function that will have a hard coded array then ask the user for a number. Use the userInput to state how many numbers in an array are higher, lower, or equal to it.
